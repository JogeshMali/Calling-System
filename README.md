# üìû Calling System ‚Äì Flutter Windows App

A robust desktop-based lead management and calling system built with **Flutter for Windows**, designed specifically for educational institutions and coaching centers to efficiently manage student inquiries, employee activities, and follow-ups. This application streamlines the process of allocating leads (students) to employees, collecting call feedback, and monitoring engagement outcomes.

## üßæ Project Description

This application enables organizations to manage a centralized database of potential students and systematically assign them to employees or telecallers based on predefined parameters such as school affiliation or student count. Users (students) can either be imported in bulk or added manually to the system.

Access is role-based: employees (EMPs) can log in to update call remarks (e.g., interested, not interested, follow-up needed), while administrators (ADMINs) are empowered to manage the entire system. Admins can view full engagement history, assign or reassign students to specific employees, and filter through all interested leads for targeted follow-up campaigns.

The system emphasizes organized communication, clarity in delegation, and accountability through detailed remark logging‚Äîmaking it an essential tool for academic outreach and admissions teams.
